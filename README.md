# Heristics-and-Propagators
Course Assignment Project for Artificial Inteligence in CSP and Modeling.
Modeling the Cagey grid.

## Propagators:
Plain backtracking propagation.
Forward checking propagation (w/ pruning)

## Heuristics:
A variable ordering heuristic that chooses the next variable to be assigned according to the Degree heuristic (DH).
A variable ordering heuristic that chooses the next variable to be assigned according to the Minimum-Remaining-Value (MRV) heuristic.

## Cagey Implementation:
A model of a Cagey grid (without cage constraints) built using only binary not-equal constraints for
both the row and column constraints.

A model of a Cagey grid (without cage constraints) built using only n-ary all-different constraints
for both the row and column constraints.

A model built using above constraints for the grid, together with cage constraints.
